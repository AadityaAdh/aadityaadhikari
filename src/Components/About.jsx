        <p>
        Hey! I'm Aaditya Adhikari, I've been close to a computer since an early age, and been passionate about it ever since.

I really liked to build stuff using no-code tools
back in 2010, and from that, I explored how to code myself, fast-forward to today, I do programming in various languages and technologies, and had the privilege to worked in a Recruitment Company
and a SaaS Company <span title='tooltiptext'>goodCompany</span>
I'm interested in building something awesome with code and automate tasks with code, currently focused on Web & Mobile Development,
Open Source
and Competitive Programming


When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some show on Netflix, or if the weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ
